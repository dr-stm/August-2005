# August-2005
This is an assignment project as a student at Kadatemy where we are being tested on creating fresh repository and adding necessary details to it.
The task simply instructs us (the students) to create a python program to display the calendar of August 2005; and further add it to our repository allongside a README file.

The title of this project is "August-2005".

I used the pandas library to create a dataframe displaying the calendar as a table with its titled columns as the days of the week.
I used the python language in Jupyter notebook to perform this task, and the screenshot of the output is attached below.
